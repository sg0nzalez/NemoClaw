# OpenShell 0.0.72 to 0.0.82 migration review

## Status and decision

This is a candidate migration review, not approval to ship OpenShell 0.0.82.
The reviewed upstream endpoint is OpenShell `main` at
[`bb72d0123c748ed7e209880f7bab593e10aae221`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/commit/bb72d0123c748ed7e209880f7bab593e10aae221).
OpenShell has not published a stable `v0.0.82` tag or release at this endpoint.
NemoClaw therefore remains pinned to `0.0.72` until the final release identity,
semantic migrations, artifact provenance, supported-platform proofs, and DGX Spark
credential-substitution proof below are complete.

The source under review includes
[`40194f935ef6e29cb07500b9109314778ab6915c`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/commit/40194f935ef6e29cb07500b9109314778ab6915c),
which prevents a credential placeholder from leaving the proxy unresolved. That
change fails closed when the resolver or TLS-termination state is missing; it does
not prove that the affected DGX Spark host can initialize that state and complete a
real credential-bearing MCP call. NVIDIA/NemoClaw#6379 remains open until the
physical Docker 27 DGX Spark reproducer reports honest status and completes a real
MCP tool call with credential substitution.

## Audit method and exact boundary

The current identity is OpenShell `v0.0.72` at
`8cb16de9eae4c44d7d31e1493747d8c10abb5963`. The candidate identity is the exact
remote `main` SHA above, not a local branch name or the moving `dev` tag.

The audit enumerated every stable adjacent tag, then read the release notes,
complete commit list, changed paths, source diffs, and upstream tests for each
range. Release notes were treated as leads rather than proof. The resulting boundary
contains 10 adjacent ranges, 46 commits, and 174 distinct changed paths in the
aggregate `v0.0.72..bb72d012` comparison.

The ledger was produced with:

```bash
collect-release-ledger.py \
  --repo <read-only-openshell-checkout> \
  --from v0.0.72 \
  --to origin/main
```

| Range | Commits | Changed paths | Diff size |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `v0.0.72 -> v0.0.73` | 5 | 27 | +1,530 / -531 |
| `v0.0.73 -> v0.0.74` | 6 | 25 | +328 / -163 |
| `v0.0.74 -> v0.0.75` | 2 | 26 | +3,416 / -5 |
| `v0.0.75 -> v0.0.76` | 3 | 28 | +2,267 / -201 |
| `v0.0.76 -> v0.0.77` | 3 | 7 | +452 / -27 |
| `v0.0.77 -> v0.0.78` | 6 | 23 | +198 / -115 |
| `v0.0.78 -> v0.0.79` | 1 | 1 | +1 / -1 |
| `v0.0.79 -> v0.0.80` | 5 | 15 | +1,373 / -96 |
| `v0.0.80 -> v0.0.81` | 4 | 9 | +617 / -24 |
| `v0.0.81 -> bb72d012` | 11 | 75 | +7,850 / -982 |

Release publication is a separate gate from source ancestry:

- `v0.0.73` through `v0.0.80` have published GitHub releases.
- The `v0.0.79` release notes repeat the `v0.0.78` change list and add only the
  `setup-uv` bump. The adjacent Git diff, not that cumulative note body, is the
  source of truth for the `v0.0.78 -> v0.0.79` range.
- `v0.0.81` is a source tag at `420a855ddc21a20ac528f902bd2ed7f3fc133dc9`,
  but it has no GitHub release. Release Tag run
  [29101552146](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/actions/runs/29101552146)
  failed the Ubuntu 26.04 rootless-Podman E2E job and skipped publication.
- OpenShell `bb72d012` produced a successful Release Dev run
  [29215426930](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/actions/runs/29215426930),
  but it does not expose one interchangeable version string. The released CLI,
  gateway, and standalone sandbox binaries report `0.0.82-dev.11+gbb72d012`;
  the pipeline Cargo version and supervisor image report
  `0.0.82-dev.11+gbb72d0123`; and Python wheel filenames use
  `0.0.82.dev11+gbb72d0123`. Development compatibility manifests must record
  the observed CLI output separately from producer and component versions. A
  moving prerelease is useful for compatibility work, but is not a stable
  selector or final provenance record.

## Artifact baseline and provenance gap

The currently shipped `0.0.72` supervisor index
`sha256:80ed9cda5bf672fefdb9dcd4604b40a8b09c0891b6eb9d03e10227c7e3dfb49d`
resolves to these exact platform identities:

| Platform | Child manifest | Config |
|---|---|---|
| Linux amd64 | `sha256:e97174326ee25c896117e854c791945d0c458a26bc9d6eab004ccd6c19d86ee7` | `sha256:b34f500c495871bf92d8a04011a210167e95f3650927b3bd67dde3ddcc021ac2` |
| Linux arm64 | `sha256:0679e02da0bd480a3e2f119dc2d205269336c9c01d7d2c8f18d05400f89d160e` | `sha256:e53f2ac5b7b3667833271f62f053887d2be9f223d2699b7e39f88c78fd9df373` |

Both child configs set `/openshell-sandbox` as the entrypoint but expose no OCI
source labels. A read-only registry audit on July 12, 2026 found that GHCR
returned no referrers index for the shipped manifest and that all 2,905
supervisor tags contained no digest-derived signature, attestation, or SBOM tag
for that index. Therefore `0.0.72` has no verifiable source-to-image attestation;
matching release tags or timestamps cannot fill the gap. The immutable index
digest is the strongest enforceable runtime control for the baseline, while the
child manifest and config identities above are audit evidence rather than source
provenance. The final `0.0.82` artifact audit must verify any upstream OCI
attestation and source labels that are actually published, or explicitly retain
this provenance gap as an unresolved supply-chain gate. NemoClaw cannot
manufacture a missing upstream attestation.

NemoClaw now validates the shape of every consumed OpenShell archive before any
extraction: the asset must contain exactly one regular file with the expected
CLI, gateway, or sandbox binary name. Absolute paths, parent traversal, extra or
duplicate members, links, and devices fail closed. This structural validation is
independent of release SHA-256 verification and also constrains the explicitly
unverified development-channel path.

### Candidate development artifact evidence

The successful `bb72d012` Release Dev run provides bounded compatibility inputs,
not release approval. The exact retained Linux amd64 artifacts inspected on July
12, 2026 are:

| Role | Actions artifact | Actions ZIP SHA-256 | Inner archive SHA-256 | Extracted binary SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CLI | `8266446648` (`cli-linux-amd64`) | `78923b27a492204b6e869d9f5f392e57b37d8ddcb9367d746f4ee46cfaf0e5a2` | `d1732c0b87801560afd1b06cfea31c60d6a357100d5b817b4a4fb181b0b71933` | `09083ef8087e5191fc3513a7239b08041b511fdeb7f2fe074bdf8820886cbea1` |
| Gateway | `8266452366` (`gateway-binary-linux-amd64`) | `39504758f07a8bac0a52d958ec56e380ac59824bde8db72a815a9b82c6bbcfd6` | `5e3728564b1f965cb5d320bab4f37d388303723f42a64c308227dbc1ef382043` | `39e75f7a2a96c220e3f2d645067f0623d922385ade07edb2037a27cc07ea81d1` |
| Standalone sandbox | `8266435047` (`supervisor-binary-linux-amd64`) | `7b2e47adbbfc644806b465a4f4c3c7bfaba7117e1f19ec9f151b37695b418bf4` | `6f7040e89ec249df7f3b36ddff609a87f096fcdf62cd5c28e86757f175e40a7a` | `58e5d99261d2b8ea06664d020995830fd3f153ea692f36622b92f9b827ea60c8` |

Each Actions ZIP contains exactly the expected archive, and each nested archive
contains exactly one regular mode-0755 root-owned binary with no links or extra
paths. The artifacts expire around July 18, 2026; their IDs are evidence only
while retained and must not become long-lived dependency selectors.

The development supervisor image resolves to immutable index
`sha256:fc441051102b1a16ffcabf59878fa464d3c548f29bfbfa6e4acb232ab67198b7`:

| Platform | Child manifest | Config | Binary layer | `/openshell-sandbox` SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux amd64 | `sha256:4a54b434decd007d2a966edb5db751adb3ca4cf8ab8ac0b248901f8efe614b71` | `sha256:5432194fa43840c333bc7b166bf6e7c0e15247e9dc195cb9a38c1a85b7415f44` | `sha256:d1baeaebaddef6291e0a94b697f28c3c319ac2ec1a83843026e89553cc7cd27e` | `8e89067afca2d1c02a25fb19906dd27fd8d524ee4eb3b2b36b1210338dae9235` |
| Linux arm64 | `sha256:fab8d5c551991648a19bf7876d2edf19fdcf4e95139ce5f75d638354c0820d51` | `sha256:66a1d121d6386e19297d05a950ba7409c5752f337bacfbc156c7c76513e40136` | `sha256:818c727cb5cbcdb78918a274ca6b9aa85be6a95fdb604e49f523cf2c87f2eba4` | `8ec9b88c49f001d070ada7bb5a98fb6f96498fc446b0f2f614056247d7300b85` |

Those image binaries byte-match build artifacts `8266448422` (amd64) and
`8266451406` (arm64), respectively. The match binds registry content to retained
Actions output, but not cryptographically to source: GitHub returned no
attestation for the index or either child manifest, and the OCI configs expose no
source, revision, or version labels. Development proof must therefore record
`attestationStatus: absent`, preserve every digest above, and avoid claiming
source-to-image provenance. The final stable release must be audited anew rather
than inheriting this development evidence.

## Adjacent release findings

### v0.0.72 to v0.0.73

Commits: `afc06dd2`, `a5161d0b`, `a2268060`, `f27ff150`, `474d2d4a`.

- `afc06dd2` clears the full Linux capability bounding set for entrypoint, exec,
  and connect children. Child launch fails when `CAP_SETPCAP` is unavailable and
  the bounding set is nonempty; it succeeds without that capability only when the
  runtime already supplied an empty bounding set. This directly intersects
  NemoClaw's Docker Desktop, WSL, Colossus, cloud, and DGX capability workarounds.
- `a5161d0b` moves selected-driver configuration acquisition into a normalized
  server path. NemoClaw renders an authenticated Docker TOML containing the
  selected driver, TLS, mTLS, JWT, supervisor image, and supervisor binary; the
  final OpenShell binary must parse that exact rendered file and preserve both
  listener paths across restart and legacy-gateway upgrade.
- `f27ff150` reserves credential names matching `v<digits>_<key>`, introduces
  revision-scoped child placeholders, retains eight resolver generations, and
  falls an evicted revision back to the current credential only when that key
  still exists. NemoClaw must reject the reserved namespace and prove rotation,
  removal, restart, and rebuild behavior rather than assuming the old unversioned
  placeholder contract.
- `a2268060` changes only upstream GPU E2E fixture execution and `474d2d4a`
  changes contributor documentation. They add no consumed runtime contract.

### v0.0.73 to v0.0.74

Commits: `ed0026aa`, `0a25fdf5`, `5477e2f2`, `914da339`, `450685c7`, `45614a3f`.

- `0a25fdf5` removes the unused gateway `extra_bind_addresses` configuration.
  NemoClaw does not emit that field, but must parse its final Docker TOML and prove
  the intended loopback and Docker-bridge reachability instead of relying on that
  absence alone.
- `450685c7` rejects leading/trailing whitespace in mount fields. NemoClaw does
  not configure production driver mounts; the test-only EXDEV tmpfs mount is the
  downstream consumer and remains a required no-impact regression.
- The Helm SAN, MCP documentation, Kubernetes combined-topology, and removed raw
  `SandboxTemplate.volume_claim_templates` changes are not consumed by NemoClaw's
  Docker gateway or CLI integration. NemoClaw has no raw OpenShell protobuf client
  for the removed field.

### v0.0.74 to v0.0.75

Commits: `abcd15d1`, `45060f44`.

Envoy Gateway TLS termination and the Gator agent manifest are native OpenShell
Kubernetes/agent surfaces. NemoClaw neither deploys that Helm topology nor selects
the Gator manifest, so these are evidence-backed exclusions from the Docker
dependency migration.

### v0.0.75 to v0.0.76

Commits: `43bb0302`, `5f9bf9ce`, `6461677c`.

- `43bb0302` changes Docker and Podman bind mounts to support SELinux relabeling,
  explicit source checks, and Docker's legacy bind representation. Production
  NemoClaw supplies no driver mounts; the EXDEV fixture remains the direct test.
- Numeric UID/GID policy identities are additive. NemoClaw continues to run the
  named `sandbox` identity and must not silently change that identity during this
  bump.
- The rootless-Podman host E2E change does not alter NemoClaw's Docker runtime.

### v0.0.76 to v0.0.77

Commits: `f852d07b`, `6252aa17`, `31807d68`.

This range contains Hermes support documentation, an unimplemented driver-config
passthrough RFC, and a workflow action bump. It adds no shipped contract consumed
by NemoClaw.

### v0.0.77 to v0.0.78

Commits: `5656240c`, `290297ff`, `9c14de7b`, `eba5dd75`, `abe42fb5`, `a7271169`.

The Podman sandbox-JWT secret delivery fix is outside NemoClaw's Docker path.
The remaining changes are documentation or removal of deprecated `--keep`
references; NemoClaw does not invoke `--keep`.

### v0.0.78 to v0.0.79

Commit: `f7aa3aa3`.

Only `astral-sh/setup-uv` changed. There is no runtime or packaging selector
consumed by NemoClaw in this adjacent range, despite the cumulative `v0.0.79`
release-note body listing older changes.

### v0.0.79 to v0.0.80

Commits: `2e2b497f`, `ed8ce820`, `5207f118`, `ff9af8e3`, `709aa0fe`.

- `ff9af8e3` acknowledges the exact initially loaded sandbox policy revision and
  reconciles an initial mismatch instead of leaving version zero/pending state.
  Status delivery uses an unbounded FIFO and retries retryable failures without a
  terminal attempt limit. Policy enforcement continues, but an older unavailable
  acknowledgement can head-of-line block later status delivery. NemoClaw must
  prove initial load, failed load, hot update, outage/recovery ordering, restart,
  and an exact policy re-read; `policy set --wait` alone is insufficient evidence.
- The Podman import fix, Docker-version typo, man-page date, and setup action bump
  do not change the consumed Docker runtime contract.

### v0.0.80 to v0.0.81

Commits: `83131d7e`, `88710225`, `49701088`, `420a855d`.

NemoClaw does not call `provider refresh configure
--secret-material-env`. Telemetry documentation and Packit target changes are
not consumed. `420a855d` adds upstream supervisor proxy-hostname regression tests
without changing product source. The failed stable publication is nevertheless a
hard artifact gate for this source tag.

### v0.0.81 to candidate main bb72d012

Commits: `5f38b7c4`, `ccdac9ce`, `caaa5165`, `8c0ecac8`, `233d207e`,
`10702133`, `bebf440b`, `8eacb477`, `614c8c16`, `40194f93`, `bb72d012`.

- `40194f93` closes two placeholder leak paths: missing resolver state now rejects
  reserved credential markers, and missing TLS-termination state returns a
  pre-200 CONNECT 503 rather than creating a raw tunnel. The upstream PR explicitly
  did not add a true connection-level test for the second branch. NemoClaw keeps
  its wire-level status probe and requires the physical #6379 tool-call proof.
- `bb72d012` permits newline and carriage-return bytes in exec command arguments
  while retaining strict NUL and non-command-field validation. NemoClaw's active
  public guard and internal base64 workarounds must be removed or reclassified,
  and byte-exact LF, CRLF, quotes, and heredoc cases must pass without weakening
  workdir or environment validation.
- `8eacb477` changes the combined Docker supervisor even though its title names
  Kubernetes. The supervisor image changes from `scratch` plus one mode-0550
  binary to Alpine 3.22 with `nftables`, `iptables`, `iptables-legacy`, and a
  mode-0555 binary. This adds an OS package, SBOM, vulnerability, license, and
  executable surface that must be reviewed and bound to the final OCI digest.
- The same commit changes generic Docker namespace nft installation from an
  atomic batch to sequential commands. Required failures can occur after the
  policy-accept chain and accept rules exist but before all IPv4/IPv6 TCP/UDP
  rejects exist; the outer Docker setup records that failure as nonfatal. The
  final runtime proof must inject failures, inspect the actual installed rules,
  and verify that direct bypass remains unavailable through restart and teardown.
- `10702133` makes each driver's default supervisor tag follow the gateway
  version. NemoClaw supplies an explicit image and supervisor binary, so the
  downstream invariant remains exact CLI/gateway/sandbox/component equality plus
  an immutable multi-architecture image digest.
- Shared child-process construction now strips `OPENSHELL_TLS_CA`,
  `OPENSHELL_TLS_CERT`, and `OPENSHELL_TLS_KEY` from entrypoint, exec, and connect
  children. Those values remain supervisor identity material; NemoClaw tests and
  comments must assert absence rather than describing child injection.
- Network binary identity now hashes the live `/proc/<pid>/exe` target. The
  migration must prove that an already-running allowed process survives on-disk
  replacement while a newly launched altered binary at the same path is denied.
- `ccdac9ce` adds sanitized MCP tool names to policy logs without logging
  arguments. This is an additive observability/privacy change and NemoClaw has no
  strict parser for the old format.
- Native Kubernetes sidecar/PVC/Helm changes, OpenShift documentation, and the TUI
  warning destination are not consumed by NemoClaw's Docker integration.

## Downstream concern ledger

| ID | Severity | Downstream consumer and failure mode | Required disposition | Current state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `OS82-01` | Critical | All stable selectors, archives, checksums, binaries, and the supervisor image could identify different builds. | Pin one published tag; verify producer run, signatures/attestations, release hashes, extracted binaries, component versions, OCI index and child manifests; reject archive traversal, links, devices, duplicates, or unexpected members. | Blocked: no stable `v0.0.82` release. |
| `OS82-02` | Critical | `mcp status` can be honest while the affected Spark still cannot initialize resolver/CA state or perform a credential-bearing request. | Physical Docker 27 DGX Spark: register credential, require status success, load tools, complete a real MCP tool call, and prove the literal placeholder never reaches upstream. | Blocked on assigned hardware proof. |
| `OS82-03` | High | `src/lib/actions/sandbox/exec.ts`, command dispatch, docs, and internal wrappers encode the old newline rejection. | Remove the obsolete public rejection; prove byte-exact LF, CRLF, quotes, and heredoc argv; retain NUL plus multiline workdir/environment rejection. | Source migration and focused tests complete; candidate runtime proof open. |
| `OS82-04` | High | OpenShell child launch now clears the complete capability bounding set. Hosts without `CAP_SETPCAP` may fail if their runtime does not pre-clear it. | Prove entrypoint, exec, and connect launch with `CapBnd=0` on Linux Docker, DGX Spark arm64, macOS Docker Desktop/Colima, WSL, and Colossus; update NemoClaw's #3280 caveat only from runtime evidence. | Open runtime gate. |
| `OS82-05` | High | Versioned credential placeholders and the eight-generation window change long-running MCP behavior. | Regenerate the exact-version child-visible manifest; reject reserved `v<digits>_` names; test more than eight rotations, removed keys, detach, restart/rebuild, fresh exec revision, expiry, and literal-placeholder scans. | Open migration and runtime gate. |
| `OS82-06` | High | Initial policy acknowledgement and ordered retry can make the active gateway status lag enforcement. | Test initial LOADED/FAILED, hot update, retry outage/recovery, restart, exact version/hash re-read, and ordered drain. | Open runtime gate. |
| `OS82-07` | High | Sequential nft setup can leave an incomplete policy-accept ruleset after a required command fails; Docker setup treats the error as nonfatal. | Inject each required failure; inspect IPv4/IPv6 TCP/UDP rules and direct-bypass negatives on Linux x86 and Spark arm64; verify restart and teardown. | Open security gate. |
| `OS82-08` | High | The supervisor image gains Alpine and three networking packages and changes binary mode. | Review SBOM, vulnerabilities, licenses, executables, modes, multiarch manifests, source labels, and OCI provenance; preserve an explicit digest. | Development image content audited; missing attestation and final stable image remain open. |
| `OS82-09` | Medium-high | Normalized selected-driver config can change the effective Docker gateway even when the TOML text is unchanged. | Parse the final rendered TOML with the final binary; prove loopback/bridge listeners, JWT/mTLS, restart, persisted state, and legacy gateway upgrade. | Open runtime gate. |
| `OS82-10` | Medium-high | Supervisor TLS identity variables are no longer child environment. Stale tests/comments can normalize a credential leak. | Assert absence from entrypoint, exec, and connect children and update the source-of-truth rationale. | Open migration gate. |
| `OS82-11` | Medium-high | Live `/proc/<pid>/exe` identity changes replacement-time policy behavior. | Prove old process survives replacement and a new altered process at the same path is denied. | Open runtime gate. |
| `OS82-12` | Medium | OpenShell declares Docker 28.0+ while #6379 is on Docker 27 and NemoClaw marks DGX Spark tested. | Either validate and document a precise downstream exception from physical proof or raise the supported floor and preflight it. | Open product/platform decision. |
| `OS82-13` | Low | Mount parsing/SELinux changes could affect the test-only tmpfs path. | Rerun the EXDEV tmpfs fixture and retain production no-mount evidence. | Open targeted test. |
| `OS82-14` | Low | Sanitized MCP tool names are newly present in logs. | Record the additive observability/privacy behavior; ensure no downstream parser assumes the old shape. | Source-reviewed; targeted log check pending. |
| `OS82-15` | High | The installer-hash workflow executes its checker and parser from the PR base SHA. One PR cannot safely teach that trusted base about a new release and consume the release; using the head checker would let reviewed code define its own trust rules. | First land archive safety, normalized full-script template validation, and multi-release trust while selectors remain `0.0.72`; prove the old base rejects a new release and the new base permits only structured release-data changes; then submit the `0.0.82` pin. | NemoClaw-only prerequisite implementation in progress. |

An unresolved critical or high concern blocks the version selector change. A green
aggregate test suite does not override an open ledger row.

## Test-selection and false-green audit

The moving-development MCP workflow currently classifies an OpenShell version
different from the versioned child-visible credential manifest as an expected
compatibility rejection, records the classification as passed, and does not run
the full managed MCP lifecycle. That is correct fail-closed behavior for an
unreviewed development runtime, but it is not evidence that the candidate is
compatible.

Before any `0.0.82` selector can be called green, the credential manifest and all
of its imports/image copies must identify the reviewed candidate, the workflow
must select `full-lifecycle`, and all three agents must complete registration,
credential rotation, DNS-rebinding denial, policy denial, real tool invocation,
restart/rebuild, and cleanup without a conditional skip or expected failure.

## Final acceptance gates

1. The trusted installer/hash prerequisite lands on NemoClaw `main` while all
   runtime selectors remain `0.0.72`. Its base-owned parser rejects operational
   installer drift and permits only validated release-data and selector changes.
2. A stable OpenShell tag contains `bb72d012` or a reviewed descendant. Re-run
   this entire adjacent-source audit for every commit between `bb72d012` and that
   tag.
3. The tag has a successful release publication. Every consumed archive and OCI
   child manifest is bound to that producer run and source identity.
4. Blueprint bounds, installer tables, Brev defaults, workflow pins, feature-gate
   hashes, supervisor digest, credential manifest, tests, and active docs select
   one coherent version.
5. Every concern-specific unit/integration proof above passes, followed by normal
   repository checks and exact-head CI/advisor review.
6. The non-skipped live matrix passes on Linux x86 Docker, macOS Docker
   Desktop/Colima, WSL, Colossus, and physical DGX Spark arm64. Legacy gateway
   upgrade, restart, rollback, and teardown remain explicit phases.
7. The physical #6379 Spark run completes an authenticated real MCP tool call and
   reports any failure honestly. Inclusion of `40194f93` alone cannot close the
   issue.
